private: means it's only callable from other functions inside the contract
internal: is like private but can also be called by contracts that inherit from this one
external: can only be called outside the contract
public: can be called anywhere, both internally and externally

view: tells us that by running the function, no data will be saved/changed
pure: tells us that not only does the function not save any data to the blockchain, but it also doesn't read any data from the blockchain. 
**Both of these don't cost any gas to call if they're called externally from outside the contract (but they do cost gas if called internally by another function)

msg.sender: address
msg.value: money payload
